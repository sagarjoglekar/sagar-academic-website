I succesfully [defended my Ph.D](https://twitter.com/nishanthsastry/status/1202944689940434944?s=20) titled ["From Communities to Crowds: Quantifying the subjective"](https://www.slideshare.net/sagarjoglekar/dissertation-presentation-203515811). The examiners recommended minor corrections to the dissertation.

The dissertation was examined by [Prof. Joemon Jose](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jj/) and [Prof. Yulan He](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/yulan_he/)

I want to sincerely thank Prof. Nishanth Sastry and all the collaborators who have mentored and enriched me in various aspects of being a researcher over the past 4 years. 

I would also like to thank King's India scholarship and the King's graduate school for supporting me during my tenure at Kings.
