The 21st century would witness one of the largest urban migration in human history. A lot of research has gone into understanding the effects of the urban life on physical and mental health. The results have been unanimous: The urban environment has long lasting impacts on our well being. The facets of our urban environment that impact on our health and well being are called the urban exposome.
In these projects, I attempt to quantify this exposome using techiques from deep learning, complex network, GIS, and NLP.

These works have got some press attention. Please find some coverages below:
