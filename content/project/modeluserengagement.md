Networked systems went through several phases over the past 40 years. In the first phase, the network was a vessel for movement of data. The second processed and stored that data in order to allow users access to services that provide unique value like music, entertainment, and e-commerce. The third was primaily powered by large companies that provided social layers to this trove of services, thereby allowing effective curation and recommendation. 
The current phase is the one where the distance between society and networked systems has all but vanished. These projects measure, model, and design systems that understand and quantify human behaviour in this fourth phase of networked systems.
