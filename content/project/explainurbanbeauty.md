summary = "Buildings and neighbourhoods speak. They speak of egalitarianism or elitism, beauty or ugliness, acceptance or arrogance. The aim of this project is to celebrate egalitarianism, beauty, and acceptance by beautifying the entire world, one Google Street view at a time. All of this is done by designing state-of-the-art technologies that make it possible to smarten a street view and read inside the Deep Learning 'black box'. **Please try the demo app out [here](https://goodcitylife.org/facelift/)**."
