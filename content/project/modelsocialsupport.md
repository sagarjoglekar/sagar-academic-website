We as a soceity have accepted the internet as an extension of the self. The online disinhibition effect sometimes allows us to open up to strangers in order to seek support, or disclose proxies for medical conditions in the process of being social on the networking platforms. In these works, I explored different models in order to capture these concepts, using methods from complex networks and NLP.
