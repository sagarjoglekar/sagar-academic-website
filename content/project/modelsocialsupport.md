We as a soceity have accepted the internet as an extension of the self. The online disinhibition effect sometimes allows us to open up to strangers online. This means, sometimes, the internet fills the gaps in intimacy, care, and support craved by the millions who are suffering or under distress. In this project, I explore the world of online support forums, using methods from complex networks and NLP to understand the nature of online support.
