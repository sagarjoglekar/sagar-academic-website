The internet has made seamless access to information, a reality. As a result, a lot of issues of the offline world, are now being voiced, shared, and discussed on the internet; including but not limited to partisan and hot button issues. As a result, phenomenona like fake news and partisan news have become a central theme for inter-disciplinary research. This project links together all the works done to investigate the hyper-partisan ecosystem and other social media processes that may have profound effects on how democracy functions in our post internet world
