<p>
I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist with over 10 years of experience bridging cutting-edge academic research and high-impact industrial applications. My expertise spans deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and complex networks, with a focus on developing novel methods that quantify human behavior from multimodal data.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I work as a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Intercom's A.I. Group, where I lead initiatives that bring cutting-edge academic research into production systems. My work focuses on advancing customer support solutions through rigorous A/B testing and the development of scalable ML architectures.
</p>

<p>
I completed my <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/from-communities-to-crowds(1365a91f-48ae-4071-b46e-f7e253745573).html">Ph.D. in Computer Science</a> at King's College London as a King's India Scholar, under the supervision of <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/nishanth.sastry/">Dr. Nishanth Sastry</a>. My doctoral research focused on quantifying signals from human behaviors driven by subjective perceptions, using data and AI to improve the world around us.
</p>

<p>
Throughout my career at organizations including Nokia Bell Labs, Expedia Group, and Citrix Systems, I have authored over 40 scientific publications in top-tier venues (Nature, WWW, ICWSM, CSCW), hold multiple patents, and have built both R&D solutions and production systems that solve real-world problems at scale.
