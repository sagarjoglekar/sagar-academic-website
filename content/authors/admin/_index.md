Hello! I am a computer scientist by training, who loves to work on problems which require building representations of human behaviour from multimodal data. I have developed representation learning methods based on NLP, graphs, and images, to solve such problems. 
<p> 

I was a King's India scholar at King's College London, where I worked on my <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/from-communities-to-crowds(1365a91f-48ae-4071-b46e-f7e253745573).html">Ph.D. in computer science </a> at the <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/sagar-joglekar(c955bb8a-f596-4474-98a1-78a1dd9d94ad).html">Department of Informatics</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/nishanth.sastry/">Dr. Nishanth Sastry</a>. 
<p>

<p>
I have graduated with a Masters of Science (M.S.) degree from the University of California at Santa Barbara USA,  majoring in signals processing and networks, and a Bachelors of Engineering (B.Eng) from the University of Pune, India, majoring in Electronics engineering <p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Scientist at Intercom, where I research and help build the next generation customer engagement software powered by the cutting edge AI tech.<p>
