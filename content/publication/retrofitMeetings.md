# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Meetings are the fuel of organizations productivity. At times, however, they are perceived as wasteful vaccums that deplete employee morale and productivity. Current meeting tools, to a great extent, have simplified and augmented the ways meetings are conducted by enabling participants to get things done and experience a comfortable physical environment. However, an important yet less explored element of these tools’ design space is that of psychological safety—the extent to which participants feel listened to, or motivated to be part of a meeting. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach would benefit the creation of new tools designed for retrofitting meetings for psychological safety. This approach comes with not only research opportunities—ranging from sensing to modeling to user interface design—but also challenges—ranging from privacy to workplace surveillance"
